INFO:root:[{'generated_text': 'Database connection timeout error occurs when the database connection times out before the application can execute its query. This error can be caused by a number of factors, including network connectivity issues, server overload, or incorrect database credentials.\n\nTo resolve this error, you can try the following steps:\n\n1. Check your network connection: Make sure that your computer is connected to the internet and that the database server is reachable. You can try pinging the server to see if it responds.\n2. Check the database server: Verify that the database server is running and that there are no issues with the server or the database. You can try logging into the server and checking the server logs for any errors.\n3. Check your database credentials: Make sure that the database credentials you are using are correct. You can try using a different set of credentials or resetting the password if necessary.\n4. Increase the connection timeout: You can try increasing the connection timeout value in your application code. This will give the application more time to establish a connection with the database.\n5. Use a connection pool: If you are using a connection pool, make sure that the pool is properly configured and that there are enough connections available.\n6. Contact the database administrator: If none of the above steps work, you can contact the database administrator for further assistance. They may be able to provide more information about the issue or help you troubleshoot the problem.'}]
